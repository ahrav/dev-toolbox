# Backlog

Future work items, upcoming workstreams, and ideas not yet scheduled for implementation.

---

## Upcoming Workstreams

<!-- 
Add planned workstreams here. Workstreams are independent units of work
that can be promoted to todo.md when ready. They don't imply sequential
dependency - pick whichever is most relevant to current priorities.

Example format:
### [Workstream Name]
- [ ] [Description of task]
- [ ] [Description of task]
-->

---

## Technical Debt

Items discovered during implementation that should be addressed but aren't blocking.

| Item | Discovered | Priority | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| <!-- Example: Unused import warnings --> | <!-- Date --> | <!-- Low/Med/High --> | <!-- Context --> |

---

## Ideas & Enhancements

Unrefined ideas for future consideration. Move to Upcoming Workstreams when ready to plan.

<!-- 
- [ ] **[Idea name]**: [Brief description]
-->

---

## Parking Lot

Items explicitly deferred or deprioritized. Include reason for deferral.

| Item | Reason | Revisit When |
|------|--------|--------------|
| <!-- Example: Feature X --> | <!-- Why deferred --> | <!-- Trigger condition --> |

---

## Notes

- Items flow: Ideas → Upcoming Workstreams → todo.md (Active Work)
- Workstreams are independent; promote based on priority, not sequence
- Technical debt items can be bundled into cleanup workstreams
- Parking lot items need explicit trigger to revisit
- When promoting a workstream to todo.md, remove it from this file

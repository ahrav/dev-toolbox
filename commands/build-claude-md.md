You are tasked with creating an ideal CLAUDE.md file for this project.

## Your Mission

Launch the `claude-md-architect` agent to perform a deep, comprehensive analysis of this project and generate an optimal CLAUDE.md file.

The agent will:
1. **Deeply analyze** the project structure, tech stack, and architecture
2. **Review all available agents** in ~/.claude/agents/ and match them to this project
3. **Generate a comprehensive CLAUDE.md** with project-specific guidance
4. **Recommend relevant agents** with clear usage guidelines

## Instructions

Use the Task tool to invoke the claude-md-architect agent with the following prompt:

```
Perform a comprehensive analysis of this project and generate an ideal CLAUDE.md file.

Take your time to:
1. Explore the entire codebase systematically using parallel searches
2. Identify the tech stack, frameworks, testing tools, and architecture patterns
3. Review all available agents in ~/.claude/agents/ and determine which are relevant for this project
4. Generate a complete, production-ready CLAUDE.md file that includes:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Development commands (setup, run, test, lint, build)
   - Architecture description and key patterns
   - **Available Agents section** with project-specific recommendations
   - Code style and conventions
   - Directory structure
   - Any project-specific best practices

Use "ultrathink" mode - be thorough and take all the time needed to create an exceptional CLAUDE.md that will significantly improve Claude Code's effectiveness on this project.

Present your findings with:
1. A summary of the project characteristics discovered
2. A list of recommended agents and rationale
3. The complete CLAUDE.md content ready to save
4. Recommendations for placement (root, parent directory, etc.)
```

Invoke the agent now and let it work autonomously to produce the best possible CLAUDE.md for this project.

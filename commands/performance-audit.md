# Performance Audit Command - Full Content

## Overview
This command guides comprehensive application performance audits across multiple dimensions.

## Complete Instructions

The audit encompasses 11 key areas:

1. **Technology Stack Analysis** - Identify primary language, framework, runtime; review build tools and monitoring

2. **Code Performance Analysis** - Detect inefficient algorithms, nested loops, unnecessary computations, and memory allocation issues

3. **Database Performance** - Examine query efficiency, indexes, connection pooling, and N+1 problems

4. **Frontend Performance** - Evaluate bundle sizes, unused code, image optimization, render cycles, and component memory leaks

5. **Network Performance** - Review API patterns, caching, payload sizes, and CDN utilization

6. **Asynchronous Operations** - Assess async/await usage, blocking operations, and parallel execution opportunities

7. **Memory Usage** - Identify leaks, garbage collection patterns, object lifecycles, and unnecessary data retention

8. **Build & Deployment** - Analyze build times, dependency bundling, tree shaking, and pipeline efficiency

9. **Performance Monitoring** - Review existing metrics, establish KPIs, set alert thresholds, and plan testing strategies

10. **Benchmarking & Profiling** - Run appropriate profiling tools, create critical path benchmarks, and document baselines

11. **Optimization Recommendations** - Prioritize improvements by impact/effort ratio with code examples and architectural suggestions

## Key Guidance
Focus on "high-impact, low-effort optimizations first" and include specific file paths, line numbers, and measurable metrics throughout the analysis.

# Architecture Scenario Explorer - Full Command File Content

This is Claude Code's official utility for systematic architectural decision-making through comprehensive scenario analysis.

## Core Purpose

The tool enables teams to "Explore architectural decisions through systematic scenario analysis with trade-off evaluation and future-proofing assessment."

## Key Framework Components

**Prerequisites Assessment**: Validates system scope, scale requirements, constraints, timeline, and success criteria before analysis begins.

**Architecture Option Generation**: Uses a structured matrix covering monolithic patterns (layered, modular, plugin-based), distributed patterns (microservices, event-driven, CQRS), hybrid approaches, and cloud-native options.

**Scenario Framework Development**: Tests architectures against load scenarios, growth projections, failure modes, and evolution requirements through multi-dimensional testing.

**Trade-off Analysis**: Systematically evaluates quality attributes across performance, scalability, development, and operational dimensions using weighted decision matrices.

**Future-Proofing Assessment**: Examines adaptability to emerging technologies (AI/ML, edge computing), market evolution, and regulatory changes.

**Architecture Simulation Engine**: Models behavior across component, integration, system, and infrastructure layers with cost integration.

**Risk Assessment**: Identifies implementation, operational, and strategic risks with specific mitigation strategies.

**Decision Documentation**: Generates Architecture Decision Records capturing context, options, rationale, implementation phases, and validation criteria.

**Continuous Evolution**: Establishes ongoing monitoring, health assessment, and incremental improvement practices.

## Success Indicators

Green indicates multiple architectures analyzed with comprehensive scenarios and validated trade-offs; Yellow suggests basic coverage; Red signals single-focus analysis with limited validation.

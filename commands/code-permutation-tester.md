# Code Permutation Tester - Command File Content

This Claude Code command enables systematic testing of multiple code implementation approaches through simulation before development. Here's the complete structure:

## Core Purpose
The tool helps developers "test multiple code variations through simulation before implementation with quality gates and performance prediction."

## Main Sections

**Prerequisites Assessment**: Validates code scope, variation types, quality criteria, constraints, and decision timeline. Guides users through missing context with structured prompts.

**Code Variation Generation**: Provides frameworks for algorithmic, architectural, technology stack, and performance profile variations. Each variation includes implementation details, quality characteristics, and resource requirements.

**Simulation Framework Design**: Establishes multi-dimensional testing covering performance profiling, maintainability analysis, scalability stress-testing, and security simulation across isolated testing environments.

**Quality Gate Framework**: Implements weighted evaluation (25% each for performance, maintainability, reliability, business factors) with specific thresholds and trade-off analysis mechanisms.

**Predictive Performance Modeling**: Forecasts real-world behavior through micro-benchmarks, integration testing, system-level analysis, and confidence interval calculations.

**Risk and Trade-off Analysis**: Evaluates technical, operational, and business risks with Pareto frontier optimization for competing objectives.

**Decision Matrix**: Generates comparative analysis with recommendations, rationale, implementation plans, and success metrics.

**Continuous Learning**: Establishes validation feedback loops and knowledge capture processes.

The command includes usage examples for algorithm testing, architecture evaluation, framework selection, and database optimization, plus quality indicators and common pitfalls to avoid.

# Comprehensive Code Quality Review Command

This command provides a structured approach to evaluating codebases across multiple dimensions. Here's the full content:

## Overview
The command guides users through eight systematic steps for thorough code assessment, starting with repository analysis and concluding with prioritized recommendations.

## Key Sections

**Initial Exploration** involves examining the repository structure, identifying the tech stack, and reviewing foundational documentation to establish context.

**Quality Metrics** focus on detecting problematic patterns, ensuring consistent styling, and eliminating redundant code elements.

**Security Assessment** emphasizes vulnerability detection, credential protection, and validation mechanisms—critical for protecting applications from exploitation.

**Performance Evaluation** addresses bottleneck identification, query optimization, and resource efficiency throughout the codebase.

**Structural Analysis** examines how code is organized, considering modularity, dependency relationships, and long-term maintainability.

**Test Strategy** evaluates coverage completeness and identifies gaps where additional validation would strengthen reliability.

**Communication Quality** assesses inline explanations, documentation thoroughness, and instructional clarity for future developers.

**Final Output** requires categorizing findings by severity level and delivering specific, implementable guidance with concrete references to affected code locations.

The framework emphasizes constructive feedback while maintaining practical specificity—reviewers should cite exact file paths and line numbers rather than making general observations.

# Constraint Modeler Command File

## Overview
This is a comprehensive simulation-modeling tool designed to help systematically analyze and document constraints within decision environments. The framework enables users to create accurate simulations through structured constraint analysis.

## Core Structure

The command file implements **9 sequential sections**:

1. **Prerequisites Assessment** - Establishes domain context and identifies missing information about what system is being modeled

2. **Constraint Taxonomy Framework** - Categorizes constraints into three types:
   - Hard constraints (absolute limits)
   - Soft constraints (manageable trade-offs)
   - Dynamic constraints (time-dependent limitations)

3. **Constraint Mapping** - Creates visualization of how constraints interact and depend on each other through matrices and hierarchies

4. **Assumption Validation** - Documents what you believe about constraints and tests those beliefs through historical and real-time methods

5. **Scenario Boundary Definition** - Uses constraints to establish realistic optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic scenario ranges

6. **Dynamic Constraint Modeling** - Analyzes how constraints evolve through linear, cyclical, or sudden change patterns

7. **Constraint Optimization Strategies** - Generates approaches for relaxing, substituting, or circumventing constraints

8. **Output Documentation** - Formats analysis into structured, actionable reports with tables and summary sections

9. **Continuous Learning** - Establishes feedback loops to improve the constraint model over time

## Key Outputs
The tool produces comprehensive constraint inventories, interaction analyses, scenario boundaries, and monitoring plans suitable for business strategy, technical architecture, product development, or operational domains.

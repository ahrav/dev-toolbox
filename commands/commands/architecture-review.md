## Complete Command Structure

The Architecture Review Command provides a 15-step comprehensive framework for evaluating system design:

### Core Analysis Areas

The command begins with **high-level mapping** of overall structure and architectural patterns (MVC, MVP, Clean Architecture), then progresses through design pattern assessment, identifying both proper implementations and anti-patterns.

**Dependency analysis** focuses on inversion of control, module coupling, and circular dependency detection. The **data flow section** examines state management, persistence strategies, and validation approaches.

### Mid-Level Reviews

**Component architecture** ensures single responsibility principles and reusability. **Error handling** coverage includes propagation, recovery, logging, and resilience patterns.

**Scalability assessment** evaluates horizontal/vertical scaling, caching, and performance bottlenecks. **Security architecture** reviews trust zones, authentication/authorization, and data protection measures.

### Higher-Order Assessments

The framework includes **testing architecture** evaluation, **configuration management** separation, and **documentation quality**.

**Future-proofing** addresses extensibility, versioning, and migration strategies. **Technology choices** and **performance architecture** round out the analysis.

### Deliverables

The final section emphasizes **actionable recommendations** with specific examples, refactoring strategies, pattern suggestions, and architectural evolution roadmaps.

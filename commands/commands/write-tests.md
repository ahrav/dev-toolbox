# Write Tests Command - Full Content Summary

This documentation page provides comprehensive guidance for writing unit and integration tests. Here are the key elements:

**Purpose:** The command helps developers write effective unit and integration tests across different frameworks and languages.

**Core Approach (18 Steps):**
The guide outlines a systematic methodology starting with framework detection and code analysis, progressing through test strategy planning, unit test implementation, and specialized testing areas like security, accessibility, and performance.

**Framework-Specific Examples:**
The document includes code templates for three major frameworks:
- Jest/JavaScript with `describe` blocks and `expect` assertions
- PyTest/Python using class-based test organization
- RSpec/Ruby with descriptive `it` blocks

**Key Testing Categories Covered:**
- Unit and integration testing fundamentals
- Mocking and stubbing strategies
- Error and exception handling
- Security and accessibility testing
- Async operations and snapshot testing
- Test maintenance and documentation

**Practical Emphasis:**
The guide stresses the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert), descriptive naming conventions, proper test isolation, and prioritizing critical business logic first.

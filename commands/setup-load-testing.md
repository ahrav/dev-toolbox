# Load Testing Setup Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for configuring load and performance testing across your application infrastructure.

## Core Components

The document outlines 10 essential steps:

1. **Strategy Development** - Analyze your architecture to identify critical components, define objectives like capacity planning, and establish performance acceptance criteria.

2. **Tool Selection** - Consider multiple options including "k6: Modern, developer-friendly with JavaScript scripting" and tools like Artillery, JMeter, Gatling, Locust, and WebPageTest based on your needs.

3. **Environment Configuration** - Establish a dedicated testing environment mirroring production with proper monitoring and data setup.

4. **Script Development** - Create test scripts simulating realistic user journeys with appropriate authentication and data management.

5. **Scenario Planning** - Design multiple testing approaches including load, stress, spike, volume, endurance, and capacity testing scenarios.

6. **Monitoring Setup** - Collect application, infrastructure, and database metrics with real-time dashboards.

7. **Execution Automation** - Automate test scheduling, result collection, and environment provisioning.

8. **Analysis & Reporting** - Implement automated performance analysis with trend detection and benchmark management.

9. **Pipeline Integration** - Embed load tests into CI/CD with performance gates and regression detection.

10. **Maintenance** - Document procedures, maintain scripts, and establish team best practices.

This structured approach ensures comprehensive performance validation throughout your development lifecycle.

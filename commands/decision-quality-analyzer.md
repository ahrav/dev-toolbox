# Decision Quality Analyzer - Full Command File

## Overview
This is a systematic framework for analyzing and enhancing team decision-making through scenario testing, bias detection, and process optimization.

## Key Components

**Decision Context Assessment**: The framework guides evaluation through five critical dimensions—decision type, process methodology, stakeholder identification, success metrics, and historical learning opportunities. It provides structured prompts when context is unclear, categorizing decisions as strategic, operational, personnel, or technical.

**Quality Framework**: Decisions are evaluated across four dimensions with equal weighting:
- "Process Quality: Information Gathering, Stakeholder Involvement, Alternative Generation, Analysis Rigor" (25%)
- Outcome Quality including goal achievement and stakeholder satisfaction (25%)
- Timing Quality balancing speed with information adequacy (25%)
- Learning Quality capturing knowledge and bias recognition (25%)

**Bias Detection**: The tool identifies individual biases like confirmation bias and anchoring, group biases such as groupthink, and organizational patterns like status quo bias. Mitigation strategies include devil's advocate roles, red team analysis, diverse perspectives, pre-mortem analysis, and psychological safety cultivation.

**Scenario Testing**: Evaluates decision processes through historical analysis, hypothetical scenarios, stress tests, and learning exercises to build organizational capability.

**Process Optimization**: Systematizes information management, stakeholder engagement, analysis methodology, and implementation planning while building team decision-making capabilities.

**Output Structure**: Comprehensive analysis including current state assessment, strengths/gaps identification, tiered recommendations (immediate/medium/long-term), success metrics, and implementation roadmaps.

**Continuous Learning**: Establishes outcome tracking, pattern recognition, and organizational knowledge capture systems.

The framework emphasizes moving from intuition-based decisions toward "systematic, evidence-driven capability that creates sustainable competitive advantage."

# Code Refactoring Command File

This is Claude Code's official command for intelligently refactoring and improving code quality.

## Overview

The command provides a comprehensive 17-step systematic approach to code refactoring, emphasizing safety and maintainability throughout the process.

## Key Phases

**Initial Analysis & Testing**
The guide starts by analyzing what needs refactoring and why, then emphasizes: "Ensure comprehensive test coverage exists for the code being refactored. If tests are missing, write them BEFORE starting refactoring."

**Refactoring Strategy**
This phase involves defining clear goals and selecting appropriate techniques like Extract Method, Rename Variable, and eliminating dead code, then planning incremental steps.

**Execution & Quality**
The approach focuses on small, focused changes with frequent testing, improving naming conventions, eliminating duplication, and simplifying complex logic.

**Verification & Safety**
The later stages include static analysis, performance benchmarking, integration testing, and code review preparation to ensure no regressions occur.

## Core Principle

The guide emphasizes: "Refactoring should preserve external behavior while improving internal structure. Always prioritize safety over speed, and maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout the process."

This command is designed for developers who need structured guidance when tackling code quality improvements across any codebase.

# Create Architecture Documentation

This guide provides a structured approach to generating comprehensive architecture documentation. Here's the full content:

## Overview
The command focuses on analyzing systems and creating detailed architectural documentation using established frameworks and best practices.

## Key Steps

**1. Architecture Analysis**
Examine system components, patterns, dependencies, and data flows to identify architectural debt.

**2. Documentation Framework Selection**
Choose from tools like C4 Model, Arc42, Architecture Decision Records, PlantUML, Mermaid, Structurizr, or Draw.io.

**3. System Context**
"Create high-level system context diagrams" and define boundaries, external integrations, and stakeholder roles.

**4. Container/Service Architecture**
Map service dependencies, deployment views, and API contracts across your infrastructure.

**5. Component Documentation**
Detail internal modules, design patterns, and code organization structure.

**6. Data Architecture**
"Document data models and database schemas" plus data flow, storage strategies, and governance.

**7. Security Architecture**
Map threat models, authentication flows, compliance requirements, and security boundaries.

**8. Quality Attributes**
Address performance, reliability, observability, maintainability, and disaster recovery aspects.

**9. Architecture Decision Records**
"Create comprehensive ADR template and process" to document decisions and trade-offs systematically.

**10. Automation and Maintenance**
Implement "automated diagram generation from code annotations" and establish review processes.
